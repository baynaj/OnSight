## Introduction
This is a project focused on preparing job seekers for technical interviews by simulating real world interview scenarios in Virtual Reality.

## Our Goal
Our project addresses the immediate need for more effective interview preparation tools, enables users to practice interview skills in a controlled, realistic environment, and also lays the groundwork for future expansion into other industries and interview scenarios with dynamic, AI-powered interactions. By combining the immersive qualities of VR with advanced AI-driven feedback and interactive tools like a virtual whiteboard, we aim to create a comprehensive and realistic interview preparation experience.
